						<h2>Music</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I have been involved in music for over 10 years now, and will continue to pursue for the rest of my life. I remember picking up the alto saxophone for the first time and immediately realizing that music would be my passion for the rest of my life.</p>

						<h2><a href="one.html">Backround</a></h2>
					</header>
					<p>The first time I played the alto saxophone I fell in love. The way it felt, and the fact that it seemed so natural for me to play was incredible. Through grade school I improved on my musical abilities trough playing classical and jazz music in my schools band program. The experiences here would visibly transcend far into my future.</p>

						<h2><a href="photo.html">Jump into Jazz</a></h2>
					</header>
					<p>During grade school I was introduced into jazz music and immediately knew that it is where I wanted to be. Jazz was able to be, from what I saw, a more creative way of expressing music. The ability to fluidly improvise and change and innovate melodies was what most appealed to me. This surly required more talent and a different mindset, than I possessed in grade school. This caused me to participate in numerous jazz band camps and music lessons to try and help improve my skill. Jazz continues to be a challenge in which I love trying to conquer every time I play.

						<h2>BVT Jam Band</h2>
					</header>
					<p>A passion for the arts is much better when shared. When I was accepted into the vocational high school I&#39;m in now they did not have a band. My passion and love was music so I knew I must help create and foster a program to promote and improve the arts. I created the BVT Jam Band with one of my fellow peers and some members of the school&#39;s faculty. This program has developed immensely over the year and a half it has been running and it continues to grow with every practice. I feel that if I helped at least one person retain their musical background I have done what I came to the school to do.
