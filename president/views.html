								<h3>Gun Control</h3>
								<p>Our views on gun control closely reflect the current policies. We have no issue of the ownership of firearms that are being used properly. We do support extensive background checks and evaluations before issuing firearms. One prevalent issue with guns in the United States is the amount of police violence. We believe police need to be evaluated more often for mental stability, as they have the power to wield a gun and use it when necessary.</p>

								<h4>Marijuana Laws</h4>
								<p>The main issue with the current marijuana laws in the United States is the fact impact they have on our prison system. According to an ACLU analysis, &ldquo;marijuana arrests now account for over half of all drug arrests in the United States. Of the 8.2 million marijuana arrests between 2001 and 2010, 88% were for simply having marijuana. Nationwide, the arrest data revealed one consistent trend: significant racial bias. Despite roughly equal usage rates, Blacks are 3.73 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana&rdquo;. Marijuana should be legalized completely, not because usage should be encouraged, but its unacceptable for prisons to be filled with perpetrators of nonviolent crimes, especially when people in colored communities are being targeted (four times more often).</p>
								
								<hr />

								<h4>Euthanasia</h4>
								<p>Assisted suicide is a dark discussion. We believe that somebody who is terminally ill, that is, somebody who has a condition that will ultimately take their life within several months or years, who are also in constant pain, should have the option of assisted suicide. It should not be recommended, but it should be an option. Often people who are terminally ill, with just months left to live, spend the rest of their time in a hospital, often in pain. This can result in massive medical bills.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>Death Penalty</h4>
								<p>The death penalty is a strange topic to discuss. On one hand, the death penalty is possibly inhumane, it could be considered a bad example for the American people, and it is a very expensive process. On the other hand, our prisons are extremely overcrowded, and some may consider a life in prison as more inhumane than a death sentence. We as a party believe the decision to allow the death penalty should be left for the state to decide. There must be some restrictions in place nationally, such as which crimes can be considered worthy of a death sentence, and a thorough examination of each case to completely prevent any wrongful accusation, and of course, the death penalty must always be as humane as possible.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>Immigration</h4>
								<p>The United States is a country built on immigration. Settlers from all over the world are what built the United States up to what it is today. Immigration shouldn&rsquo;t be looked at with a negative light. Migrating to the United States should always be an option, but it should not be done illegally. The process of legally immigrating should be simplified so reduce the amount of illegal immigration. Immigration has been prevalent as a crucial part of the United States for its entire history. Everybody who lives in the United States comes from a family of immigrants, and should be open to letting immigration continue legally.</p>
