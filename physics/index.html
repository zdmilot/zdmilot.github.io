								<h2>Story</h2>
								<p>I, Jake Rota, was born in Boston, Massachusetts. I spent much of my young years in Columbia Law School studying to follow in the path of my hero &oline; Teddy Roosevelt. After receiving my Bachelor of Law, I became the mayor of New York. After 13 years as mayor, I believe it is time to take my understanding and experience to a higher level. As a child my hobbies included riding horses, hiking the Appalachian mountains, and being outdoors never the nations beautifull shores. The presidential office is always something which I had strived for as a politician, because I want to make a positive change in the United States. Some key issues in the United States that need to change in my office are our deficit spending, our gender wage gaps, the decriminalization of marijuana, our climate change policies, offering more opportunities for America&rsquo;s youth, protecting the people, improving the prison systems, and reducing gun violence and police violence. We believe that there should be no punishment for the possession, with intention to use, of marijuana because prosecution can be particularly detrimental to someone&rsquo;s future; especially for such a nonviolent crime. Our party and myself both agree that being able to have marijuana legalized will have a positive impact on not only the economy but also the prosecution rates in the United States. The climate is not only just a national issue but a world issue, the climate is rapidly changing and there is indisputable evidence to suggest human involvement in the worsening of our environment. This is why I and my constituents believe that we must take a stand on this issue, giving more tax breaks for those corporations and homes who participate in using renewable energy. If we could generate the momentum needed to begin working on preventing climate change, subsequent presidents could continue where I left off and lead to a brighter and cleaner future not only for the United States, but for the world as a whole. The youth of the United States needs a promise of a brighter future and have the opportunity to live out the American dream of our forefathers. I believe that I will be a candidate which would be able to change the way the American people think in a positive direction, and be able to steer America&rsquo;s economy to a brighter future. I was born in a place where different people are biased based on many different characteristic and I believe all need a fair shot. During my days as mayor, I have had a significant impact on the city of New York, as well as learned very much about how to deal with the many similar problems the United States as a whole has to deal with. Whilst I was the mayor, I paved the way for new legislature that firmly embodied the spirit of freedom central to the American dream. I also pioneered a new movement for a more reasonable gun control system which would have better methods for background checks to prevent criminals or those who are mentally ill from being able get their hands on guns. The system would additionally improve the accessibility of guns to law abiding citizens. These laws would help keep the citizens of the United States safe and help make sure that tragedies do not happen nearly as often. From this position of leadership, I have gained the knowledge and experience needed to lead this country to greatness. I believe that I will be a great candidate for the presidency and help lead the United States of America to a brighter future.</p>
