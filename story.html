<h1>My Story</h1>
<br>
    My name is Zachary Milot, and I live in Bellingham, Massachusetts. I am 17 years old and a senior at Blackstone Valley Regional Vocational Technical High
    School in Upton, Massachusetts. In my school, I am in the Information Technology shop. I am currently taking Honors English, Career Enrichment IV, AP
    Calculus AB, Engineering Design and Development, Honors American Government, and Honors Physics for academic classes. To have the ability to take these
    challenging courses and better myself, I must understand my strengths and weaknesses.
<br>
    My signature character strengths are appreciation of beauty and excellence, creativity, curiosity, leadership, love of learning. Finding and knowing these
    strengths help me find what I am good at doing and what I can focus on what I want to do. Appreciation of beauty and excellence is one of my strongest
    character strengths. I enjoy studying art, literature and music, and I believe that studying great artists, writers and musicians help me understand the
    history of wonderful thinkers of the past and present. I believe that creativity defines me as a person because I always try to express my creativity in
    everything that I do. Curiosity is one of my signature character strengths because I am interested in science and am always curious how things work and
    operate. This character strength helped me find what shop would be the right shop for me because I was curious about how computers run and operate. These
    character strengths help define me as a person and understanding my top character strengths helps me decide what I want to do on a daily basis and what
    vocation I would want to study in High School and College.
<br>
    My studies in the vocational and technical skills area in my High School include computer repair, networking, computer science, programing, web design,
    photography, and videography. Freshmen year in my shop I learned computer repair and web design. In the computer repair section of the course I learned the
    basics of what a computer does, troubleshooting, and the types of components in a personal computer. In web design, we learned HTML and basic design
    aspects of creating an aesthetically pleasing. In my sophomore year I learned advanced computer repair, networking, and web development. In advanced
    computer repair I learned advanced troubleshooting, and how to repair a computer. In networking we learned the basics of a computer network, home networks,
    and the basics of network troubleshooting. In web development, we learned how to manage a web design and development project and how to create the right
    website for the customer. In junior year I have learned computer science, programming, networking, and videography. In computer science, I have learned how
    a computer processes information. In programming I have learned in computer programming, the basics of Java and Python Programing. I have learned in
    networking different types of networks and how to complete basic troubleshooting. In videography, I have learned the basics of a camera and different types
    of movements that one could do with a camera and how to use these motions to convey a message. During the summer of my junior year and throughout my senior
    year I have participated in a co-op opportunity at TMC Environmental in Franklin MA. Through this experience, I was able to learn about working in a
    professional environment, Microsoft PowerShell, in-depth java, customer relations, and in-depth computer repair. I have learned many things during my High
    school career and will continue to learn much more throughout the rest of my time in High School.
<br>
    My academic studies have included Honors English, Career Enrichment, AP Calculus AB, Honors Pre-Calculus, Honors Geometry, Honors Algebra, Honors English,
    Spanish, Engineering Design and Development, History II, Honors Chemistry, Honors Biology, Honors Physics, Oceanography, and Aquaculture. In the Sciences,
    I have completed two years of High School Biology, one year of Honors Chemistry, and am currently in Honors Physics, I have also completed Oceanography,
    and Aquaculture dual enrolment courses at Massachusetts Maritime Academy. In Mathematics I have completed one year of Algebra, One year of Geometry, one
    year of Pre-Calculus, and am currently in Calculus. In History, I have completed two years of History and am currently in World History. I am currently in
    and have completed two years of Spanish and Career Enrichment. Throughout my academic Career at Blackstone Valley Tech and Massachusetts Maritime Academy,
    I have exceeded my goals and expectations of what I could learn and do. These academic studies helped shaped me into someone who is more aware of what is
    going on around the world and how things work. The skills in which I have learned at a High School level will be built upon in the near future both in and
    past High School to help me know more.
<br>
    During my four years my extracurricular activities include a Jazz Band at Franklin School for Performing Arts, Jazz band at my school, National Honor
    Society, Math Club and a Programing Class online with MIT. I have tried to do more extracurricular activities this year than I did last year to try and
    gain more knowledge and be a part of a group. Along with these extracurricular activities I and another student are creating a Jazz band at my High School
    as well. Throughout the year, I might have to limit what I do for extracurricular activities but for now they are exciting and help me be a part of a group
    with similar interests. I was just recently accepted to be a part of the National Honor Society at our school and am the first one in my entire family to
    be a part of NHS. I have also been a part of this Jazz group in Franklin for a couple of years now and have learned so much about music and improved my
    improvisational skills. I joined the math club to help push myself because I struggle with math some of the time, and it is a way to help improve my skills
    in that field of study. I have joined the MIT Programing class to learn more about my vocational field at a college level. I want to strive and make senior
    year the most rewarding as I can and extracurricular activities can help me in this process
<br>
    Since I was 10 I have been working at the Hockomock Area YMCA in Franklin, Massachusetts. I started to volunteer at the YMCA to help out the community and
    help others. There I have volunteered as a helper to the Member Service Desk, the sports camps, aquatic camps, and theater camps. I have also volunteered
    at the Franklin Food Pantry to help out in checking dates on canned food. Another place in which I have volunteered was at Crossroads Clubhouse during
    their annual pancake breakfast. This is an organization that helps mentally challenged individuals find help with jobs, counseling, education, and housing.
    I have tried to be a large supporter of organizations in my community, and I would love to be able to help more people in different organizations. Giving
    back to our community is very important to me, and I was taught by my parents that giving back is a good way to help the community grow and develop to a
    more caring society.
<br>
    I currently design websites for companies in my spare time. One of these companies, Benchmark Fire Protection, has decided that I would be a good fit to
    help them with any technical needs that they might have and was hired to be there Information Technology Services Coordinator. But my job experience does
    not include much else. For my first actual job, I would like to work at TMC Environmental as a paid intern helping the Information Technology Director with
    projects. I would like to have a good amount of work experience in my field and be able to know how a company runs their technology department to get a
    better feel of if I want to be in the Information Technology field all of my life.
<br>
    Some career goals that I have for my future are getting an internship in a technology department, and work a Google. I would want an internship at a
    company to gain experience working in a business setting. I would like to be able to learn from people who are in the technology field now and gain more
    information about my field. An internship would also help me figure out if this field is right for me because working in my field it would give me a
    different perspective than just learning it. My other career goal is to work a Google. This is one of my career goals because I have used their products
    since I was a young child, and their innovations are astounding. Although that is not what inspired me to work there it was the attitude of Googles
    employees and the working environment which made this desire to work there. The treat everyone nicely and they try to create a creative environment to help
    spark imaginations and moonshot thinking. Their technology has changed the way we view our world. They pushed a new and unknown organization called
    Android into a mobile platform in which over a billion people use. They have created new form factors of technology including wearable computing glasses to
    self-driving cars and much more. I believe I am a creative individual, and I believe if I work there they would allow me to use my imagination to improve
    the way people interact with technology. Even If I do not get a chance to work for Google there are many technology companies and there is always a next
    time to apply for another job there.
<br>
    On a daily basis, I try to be happy and thankful for everything and everyone I have in my life. I am truly happy knowing that everything that I do in high
    school will help me when I am older. I feel happy when I am able to use my knowledge and use my creativity at the same time. This is when I am able to
    design a website or write a piece of creative writing. I love to be able to use creativity in what I do and add me into something. I love to read books
    because they help me paint world in my head, and writing stories because they help me create these exciting worlds in my head too. I love just sitting down
    and thinking to myself. I love to think about how to revolutionize the way we live in this world and how to make a lesser global footprint for all. I love
    to think and dream and build my creativity through gaining new knowledge to help me understand more about this world. I thoroughly enjoy learning and
    gaining knowledge to help me in the future. I am also happy when I am engaged in something.
<br>
    When I am engaged in something or in the zone I like to be using my creative part of my brain. I love to make art in both a musical sense and a physical
    sense. I like to design websites for different companies, and I enjoy creating things like poetry, or creative writing. Ever since I learned how to code
    HTML in web design class I have been using my knowledge to design web sites and be able to create something that was just a thought in my brain to
    something which is live on the internet for customers to see. I also love to play, listen, and feel the music. There was what my middle school called an
    instrument petting zoo when we had an orientation for 5th grade, and I remember picking up the saxophone for the first time and immediately falling in love
    with it. I was able to play hot cross buns which I shocked both myself and the band teacher at the time. Throughout the years, I have been playing I have
    developed new styles and ways of playing. I now play in a Jazz band outside of school and am able to improvise.
<br>
    I believe that the most important relationships which I have created with my family have helped shape who I am and have supported me in being myself, and
    doing what I love to do. My mom and dad have supported me with what I have wanted to do. These things are going to Blackstone Valley Tech and learning an
    instrument. My mom is a big inspiration to me because she came to this country as a girl who did not speak any English, and eventually served in the
    military 21 1/2 years. She is the true depiction of the American dream and her perseverance and determination to become who she is today is very inspiring.
    She still inspires me today because she is giving back to the community even more by helping the less fortunate obtain scholarships to the YMCA. My dad who
    is another inspiration to me has been a member of the fire department for 30 years helping to save peoples lives. He has been very active in the community
    as well and led many community service projects at the YMCA for many years. These two amazing people are no doubt the most amazing people I know their
    dedication to the community and others comes before anything else and they helped shape who I am today.
<br>
    The thing that brings a sense of purpose in my life is my willingness to give back to the community through volunteering and helping to be a part of these
    groups in my community. I find meaning by having the ability to give to people whether it is your time or financial contribution, as well as being able to
    teach what you have learned through life experiences to the next generation so they can hopefully be better than you which leads to a better society.
    Meaning and purpose in my life is defined by how hard I work to help others and help myself grow and develop as well. Some ways I can develop meaning in my
    life is to be able to accomplish so much and share how I accomplished these tasks.
<br>
    Throughout my High School career, I have had some accomplishments. Some of these include getting my CompTIA A+ Certification during the end of sophomore
    year as well as receiving a PC Pro Certification over the summer. I have also been fortunate enough to have a school that requires an OSHA certification
    which I accomplished freshmen year. I have also been accepted to the National Honor Society and am the first in my family to do so. I have received the
    Perfect Attendance Award in both freshmen and sophomore years and have received the Outstanding Student Award in my shop as well as the Most Improved in
    Spanish Award. I have also completed two courses at Massachusetts Maritime Academy including Introduction to Oceanography as well as Aquaculture I. I have
    had many opportunities from my school and been supported by very good people.
<br>
    The first moment I stepped into Blackstone valley Tech I felt a feeling of unity and community among the students and staff. The Blackstone Valley Tech
    community is filled with a caring, and compassionate group of diverse people from all walks of life looking to get an amazing education. At Blackstone
    Valley Technical, people come from 13 different communities to form a one united community of its own. In both my own community and at the Blackstone
    Valley Tech community, I strive to help in any way that benefits others. For example, during sophomore year my shop had a student who just switched into
    the shop and I volunteered my time on Tuesdays and Thursdays to help him learn the basic concepts of IT. The community that is formed at Blackstone Valley
    Tech is a strong, caring, compassionate, and diverse set of peoples.
<br>
    Beyond High School, I want to strive to build positive building blocks of my future in order to get to where I want to be after college. I have to learn
    more knowledge so that I can share that with the next generation and use that knowledge also to help me learn as well. High School has been an amazing
    experience filled with opportunity and challenges which help us grow as a human. In my future, I want to build on and accomplish these goals in order to
    become more successful and be able to know more about myself and the world around me. Throughout my life, I have had supportive relationships with both
    friends and family which I hope strengthen over time and develop a bond that can never be broken. I have come so far in just a short amount of time I have
    been here on this planet and I hope I enjoy every second of my life ahead of me because I know that life will be both bot rewarding and a bumpy ride. In
    the words of Sai Baba Life is a song - sing it. Life is a game - play it. Life is a challenge - meet it. Life is a dream - realize it. Life is a sacrifice
    - offer it. Life is love - enjoy it.
